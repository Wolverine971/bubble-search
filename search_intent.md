# Google Search Intent Classifications

Based on my research, here are all the search intent types with clear definitions:

## Traditional/Core Search Intents

**Informational Intent**: When users want to learn or find information about a topic (e.g., "how does photosynthesis work", "what is blockchain")
**Navigational Intent**: When users are looking for a specific website or page (e.g., "Facebook login", "NYT homepage")
**Commercial Intent**: When users are researching products or services before making a purchase decision (e.g., "best smartphones 2025", "insurance comparison")
**Transactional Intent**: When users are ready to complete a specific action like making a purchase (e.g., "buy iPhone 16", "order pizza")
**Local Intent**: Searches for nearby businesses, services, or locations (e.g., "coffee shops near me", "dentist Orlando")
**Comparative Intent**: When users want to weigh options between similar products or services (e.g., "Android vs iPhone", "Hulu vs Netflix")
**Pre-Informational Intent**: Users just beginning to explore a broad topic without specific questions (e.g., "nutrition basics", "getting started with photography")
**Visual Intent**: When users want to see images or visual representations (e.g., "sunset photos", "kitchen design ideas")
**Video Intent**: When users specifically want video content (e.g., "how to tie a tie video", "funny cat videos")
**Local Service Intent**: Specifically seeking service providers in a geographic area (e.g., "plumbers in Chicago", "lawn care services near me")
**News Intent**: When users want current information about recent events (e.g., "latest tech news", "election results")
**Entertainment Intent**: Searches focused on amusement or leisure content (e.g., "funny jokes", "online games")
**Specific Question Intent**: Users seeking direct answers to specific questions (e.g., "how tall is the Eiffel Tower", "when was Google founded")
Google's search algorithm has evolved to identify these various intents and deliver results that best match what users are truly looking for, rather than just matching keywords.
