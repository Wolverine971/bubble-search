this is good now I want you to apply some advanced animations using animejs.
When the user clicks search I want you to lock in the search box and search query as if it is being set in stone. It should appear as if the search box got set in stone or marble and is solid.

Then when the search query comes back I want you to show the search intent as a bubble bubbling up above the now stone search box. And the bubble will pop and the search intent will be positioned as a bubble on the top right of the search query.
